            <h1>Gravity Falls Journals: Secrets & Hidden Lore</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Origin of the Journals</h2>
            <p>The three journals in Gravity Falls—Journals 1, 2, and 3—are packed with paranormal research, cryptic codes, and forbidden knowledge. Stanford Pines (Grunkle Stan's twin brother), a brilliant scientist, wrote them to catalog the supernatural phenomena in Gravity Falls before being pulled into another dimension. Originally for research, but later used as a survival guide and secret weapon against entities like Bill Cipher.</p>
